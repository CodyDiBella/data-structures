This project contains implementations of several common data structures in JavaScript:

- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Search Tree

## Big O notation

### Stack

| Operation | Average Case | Worst Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Push | O(1) | O(1) |
| Pop | O(1) | O(1) |
| Peek | O(1) | O(1) |
| Search | O(n) | O(n) |### Queue

### Queue

| Operation | Average Case | Worst Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enqueue | O(1) | O(1) |
| Dequeue | O(1) | O(1) |
| Peek | O(1) | O(1) |
| Search | O(n) | O(n) |### Binary Search Tree

### Binary Search Tree

| Operation | Average Case | Worst Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Search | O(log n) | O(n) |
| Insert | O(log n) | O(n) |
| Delete | O(log n) | O(n) |
| Traversal | O(n) | O(n) |
